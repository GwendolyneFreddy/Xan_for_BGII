An NPC mod for Baldur's Gate II (BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, EET)!

This mod adds Xan as a joinable NPC for Baldur's Gate II (BGII, BGII:EE, BGT, EET). 
Xan, a non-player character from the first game in Baldur's Gate series, is a depressed elven mage - enchanter. Notable quotes: "We're all doomed." "Life is so hollow." "It is hardly worth the effort of trying."
"What is the point?" "Our quest is vain." "Onward, to futility!"

This mods adds him to BGII, with a friendship path and the possibility to romance Xan, including a continuation of the BG1 Xan romance from the BG1NPC Project.
